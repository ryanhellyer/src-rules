[u][lightblue]Article 2.2 – General Conditions[/lightblue][/u]

During an event, each driver has the responsibility that they and all other parties will respect the rules in their entirety.
Each driver is responsible for ensuring that the technical conditions for their system environment (PC hardware and software, routers, switches, cabling, input and output devices, etc.) meet the requirements of the event to ensure smooth running.
WiFi should be avoided for your own benefit (due to lagging).



[u][lightblue]Article 2.3 – General discipline and safety[/lightblue][/u]

[u]Bug use & modifications[/u]

It is strictly forbidden to use bugs to your own advantage, if one is discovered, please report it to Paul23 or Tangofoxx via PM in the forum or Skype. It is strictly forbidden to modify the official mod files to your own advantage (i.e. to get more grip).


[u]Direction of driving[/u]

It is strictly forbidden to steer your vehicle against the normal direction of travel. This is solely permitted to remove a car from a dangerous position and thus not to endanger other drivers.


[u]Cutting[/u]

The Curb is part of the track. There must be at least two tires on the track, otherwise it counts as a cut. A cut is when you leave the track to save time. If you come off the track by accident, just slow down so there is no time gained by leaving the track. A cut may be punished.


[s]
ESC control in official sessions

If a vehicle outside of the pitlane, for whatever reason, comes to a standstill, it is prohibited to hit the escape button! One is only allowed to use the ESC Button, when in the pitlane (race). In qualifying it is always allowed to press ESC. Read more at 'Safety Car (SC)'.[/s]

[u]Lights[.u]

Lights are allowed to be used when the driver feels like it's neccessary. When lapping /overtaking/on a hotlap, the headlight flasher is allowed. Excessive use of these should be prevented, i.e. using it for many laps in a row. Flashing may also cause lower framerate on the flashed drivers PC, please remember that before you flash.


[u]Chat[/u]

The use of the chat during qualifying and the race should be prevented, because it is distracting to people on the track. [s]For an exception see 'Safety Car (SC)'.[/s]


[u]Lapping (blue flag)[/u]

If the lapping car is clearly quicker than the lapped car, a lapping manoeuvre should be made possible,within 3 - 4 curves. The lapped driver has to ensure that the lapping car can overtake, without losing too much time in an easy move.


[u]Accidents (yellow flag)[/u]

The yellow flag will be shown when a car is going slow or had an accident. This means that the drivers need to pay more attention in this area. Under yellow flags it is prohibited to overtake, it is also neccessary to reduce your speed. If a driver causes an accident, by overtaking under yellow flag, they will get a penalty.

If the car is still driveable (i.e. just a tire blew up), the driver can go back to the pits to repair the damage. In this case the driver has to step away from the racing line and stay aware of the other drivers and not block or endanger them. If a car is immobile after an accident, it needs to remain at its position until the complete grid passed it once, after that the driver is allowed to use the ESC key. Read more at 'Safety Car (SC)'.


[strike][u]Safety Car (SC) [if available][/u]

If a driver crashes he must type 'CRASH' into the chat to inform the Race Control who is deciding about the use of the Seafety Car. If no SC will be deployed see 'Accidents (Yellow Flag)'. If the SC drives out it will be displayed in chat by the words 'Safety Car Deployed', overtaking is not allowed while SC is out. While it is deployed the drivers need to reduce the speed on the complete track and especially in the area of the accident. The SC will capture the driver on the first place and the complete grid is lining up.
Meanwhile the crashed driver needs to remain at his position until the Race Control allowes him to use the ESC key, which will be shown by the words 'Accident site cleared'.

During the SC session the drivers are allowed to unlap them when the race control types 'unlapping allowed'. The drivers in the front should move to the right side to allow the lapped drivers to pass by on the left side.

When the SC comes back into the pit it will be shown by 'SC in this lap'. From now on the driver on position 1 is leading the field and specifying the speed, overtaking is allowed after passing the line and the race has been restarted.[/strike]


[u][lightblue]Article 2.4 – Name, Number & Skins[/lightblue][/u]

Your name in rFactor should be the same as in the forum, just to reduce confusions.

The car number (between 2 and 99) can be chosen by the driver during registration.

Every driver is allowed to create a skin of their own. The skin may NOT contain political statements or swearing. The skin has to be identified and permitted as a “racing skin” by Tangofoxx or Paul23. For questions, contact Tangofoxx or Paul23.



[u][lightblue]Article 2.5 – Practice[/lightblue][/u]

There will be two practice sessions before every race. The first practice Session FP1 (free practice 1) will be on Saturday one week before the race day, starting at 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST). This is just a short session, you are allowed to do everything. If you want to do reverse race it is okay, it's more like a fun session.

FP2 (free practice 2) will be on Friday just before the race, starting at 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST). This is the official preparation for the race. FP2 will last for 1 hour. You are able to test your car in race conditions, this means drive like you do in the race. There is no participation compulsory for FP1 and FP2.



[u][lightblue]Article 2.6 – Drivers Briefing[/lightblue][/u]

There may be a short briefing by the race control starting at 19:30 / 7:30 PM (CET / CEST). It will take place on the [URL=http://seacrestrc.xobor.de/t1f2-Server-Information-amp-Teamspeak.html#msg2]Teamspeak Server (click me!)[/url] in the rFactor section. Drivers will be given information about the latest changes, newest rules, the track and difficult / dangerous areas of it. Attendance is not compulsory, but if a driver causes an accident or breaks a rule by not knowing or ignoring the given information, they may get a harsher punishment.



[u][lightblue]Article 2.7 – Qualification[/lightblue][/u]

Every driver is allowed to participate in the qualifying & race even if they have not practiced at all. If a driver has caused many accidents in races, they may be required to pre-qualify. Pre-qualification may involve requiring a certain lap time during practice or reaching a certain number of laps before the drivers briefing.

[strike]Drivers are only eligible to participate in qualification and the race if they are within 104% of their fastest class lap ~23 hours before the race (right after FP2). This means 104% counted from the fastest PRO and AM time. If a driver is above 104% they've still got time until the drivers briefing. Times will be checked before qualifying with this Tool:[/strike]

[URL=http://seacrestrc.liveracers.com/Live/?server=Seacrest%20Racing%20League]Live-Tracker (click me!)[/url]

Qualification will start at 19:40 / 7:40 PM (CET / CEST) – a no show will result in a disqualification for the qualifying and the driver needs to start from the pits.
The qualification will be 15 minutes long unless stated otherwise. The endurance races (Nürburgring Nordschleife, Le Mans, Bathurst) will have a 1 hour qualifying starting at 13:45 / 2:00 PM (CET / CEST).
Both classes will be on track at the same time, during your in & outlap be aware of the other drivers on a hotlap.

If a driver feels like the tracker is not working properly, they need to mention it. In this case, race control will check if there is a problem. If the suspicion is confirmed, the driver will be allowed to race.

[strike]The maximum times will be announced here: [URL=http://seacrestrc.xobor.de/t53f7-Qualification-times.html]Qualification times (click me!)[/url][/strike]



[u][lightblue]Article 2.8 – Warm up[/lightblue][/u]

A 5 minute warm up will be held between qualification and the race. This may be used for toilet break / eating / drinking). Endurance races will have a 15 minute warm up.


[u][lightblue]Article 2.9 – Starting procedure[/lightblue][/u]

The race weekend consists of 2 races. A 40 minute race and a 20 minute race with a reversed grid (40:20R)
At 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST) the first race will start. The endurance race will start at 15:00 / 3:00 PM (CET / CEST).

The start will happen behind the SC. After the start lights go out, the actual formation lap starts. Please let the car in front of you start before you start to move and leave some place between each other, to reduce accidents while warming up tires / brakes.
The SC will drive at a moderate speed (around 120 km/h) the gap to the car behind should not be more then 5 - 6 car lengths.
Overtaking is not permitted. If a car spins off, it is allowed to get back on track and join in the original position – the driver has to make sure they do not endanger other drivers while getting back to their grid position.

In sector 3 the grid gets ready for the start. The drivers go into two rows and follow the SC. The drivers stay on the sidee they were standing in the starting grid, left stays left - right stays right. While being in two rows the drivers go side by side. The drivers are allowed to offset to the left or to the right for better overtaking, they just need to stay behind the 2 row infront of them. The SC will go into the pits at the end of the lap. When it turns into the pits, it will write "Green Flag!" within the next seconds. At the second, it appears, the race is started. Everyone is allowed to overtake and accelerate from this moment.


[u][lightblue]Article 2.9a – Restarts[/lightblue][/u]

Within the first lap, if at least 3 drivers are involved in crashes, the race will be restarted. The 3 drivers need to write “crash” into the chat. There will be a maximum of 1 restart per race (starting procedure included). Exceptions can be declared by the Admins or Moderators.



[u][lightblue]Article 2.10 – Pit Stop[/lightblue][/u]

[u][lightblue]Article 2.11 – Race end[/lightblue][/u]

As soon as time is up and the leader has crossed the finish line, the race is over. All drivers have to cross it as well to finish the race. All Drivers have to drive their cars into the pits.

There may be a short race briefing starting at 7:30 PM / 19:30 (GMT). This briefing will be held on the official Teamspeak in the rFactor section.
