Article 2.3 – General discipline and safety

Bug using & Modyfing

It is strictly forbidden to use bugs to your own advantage, if there is one discovered, please report it to Paul23 or Tangofoxx via PN in the forum or Skype. It is strictly forbidden to modify the official mod files to your own advantage (i.e. get more grip).


Direction of driving

It is strictly forbidden to steer your vehicle against the normal direction of travel. This is solely permitted to remove his car from a dangerous position and thus not to endanger other participants continue.


Cutting

The Curb is part of the track. There must be at least two tires on the track, otherwise it counts as a cut. A cut is, when you leave the track to save time. It may happen, that you get off the track by accident, in that case just slow down so there is no time gained by leaving the track. A cut can be punished.


ESC control in official sessions

If a vehicle, for whatever reason, outside of the pitlane, comes to a standstill, it is prohibited to hit the escape button! One is only allowed to use the ESC Button, when in the pitlane(Race). In Qualifying it is always allowed to press ESC. Read more at 'Safety Car (SC)'.


Lights

Light is allowed to use, when the driver feels like its neccessary. When lapping /overtaking/beeing on a hotlap, the headlight flasher is allowed. Excessive use of these should be prevented, i.e. using it for many laps in a row. Flashing may also cause lower framerate on the flashed drivers PC, please remember that before you flash.


Chat

The use of the chat during qualifying and the race should be prevented, because it is distracting people from the track. For an exception see 'Safety Car (SC)'.


Lapping (Blue Flag)

A lapping manoeuvre should be made possible, by the lapped driver, within 3-4 curves, if the lapping car is clearly quicker than the lapped car. The lapped driver has to ensure, that the lapping car can overtake him, without losing too much time in an easy move.


Accidents (Yellow Flag)

The yellow flag will be shown when a car is going slow or had an accident. This means that the drivers need to pay more attention in this area. Under yellow flags it is prohibited to overtake, it is also neccessary to reduce the speed. If a driver causes an accident, by overtaking under yellow flag, he will get a penalty.

If the car is still driveable (i.e. just a tire blew up), the driver can go back to the pits to repair the damage. In this case the driver has to step away from the racing line and be aware of the other drivers, not to block or endangering them. If a car is immobile, after an accident, it needs to remain at its position until the complete grid passed it once, after that the driver is allowed to use the ESC key. Read more at 'Safety Car (SC)'.


Safety Car (SC) [if available]

If a driver crashes he must type 'CRASH' into the chat to inform the Race Control who is deciding about the use of the Seafety Car. If no SC will be deployed see 'Accidents (Yellow Flag)'. If the SC drives out it will be displayed in chat by the words 'Safety Car Deployed', overtaking is not allowed while SC is out. While it is deployed the drivers need to reduce the speed on the complete track and especially in the area of the accident. The SC will capture the driver on the first place and the complete grid is lining up.
Meanwhile the crashed driver needs to remain at his position until the Race Control allowes him to use the ESC key, which will be shown by the words 'Accident site cleared'.

During the SC session the drivers are allowed to unlap them when the Race Control types 'Unlapping allowed'. The drivers in the front should move to the right side to allow the lapped drivers to pass by on the left side.

When the SC comes back into the pit it will be shown by 'SC in this lap'. From now on the driver on position 1 is leading the field and specifying the speed, overtaking is allowed after passing the line and the race has been restarted.



Article 2.4 – Name, Number & Skins

Your name in rFactor should be the same as in the forum, just to reduce confusions.

The Car number can be chosen at the registration by the driver. You can pick your number between 2 and 99.

Every user is allowed to create a skin on his/her own, if he/she doesn’t want to use the given skins. The skin may NOT contain political statements or swearing. The Skin has to be identified and permitted as a “racing skin” by Tangofoxx or Paul23. For questions, contact them.



Article 2.5 – Practice

There will be two Practice Sessions before every race. The first Practice Session FP1 (Free Practice 1) will be on Saturday one week before the race day, starting at 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST). This is just a short session, you are allowed to do everything. If you want to do reverse race it is okay, it's more like a fun session.

FP2 (Free Practice 2) will be on friday just before the race, starting at 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST). This is the official preperation for the race, FP2 will last for 1 hour. You are able to test your car in race conditions, this means drive like you do in the race, no fun session. There is no participation compulsory for FP1 and FP2.



Article 2.6 – Drivers Briefing

There can be a short briefing by the Race Control starting at 19:30 / 7:30 PM (CET / CEST). It will take place on the Teamspeak Server (click me!) in the rFactor section. The drivers will get information about the latest changes, newest rules, the track and difficult / dangerous areas of it. There is no compulsory attendance but if a driver causing an accident / breaking a rule by not knowing or ignoring the given information, he may get a harsher punishment.



Article 2.7 – Qualification

Every driver is allowed to participate in the Qualifying & Race even if he/she has not practiced at all. If a driver has caused many accidents etc. he can get Pre-Race-Penalty. These penalty can be a certain lap time the driver has to reach or a certain amount of laps that need to be done, both before the Drivers Briefing. The Time / Laps will be checked with the tool below:

Eligible to participate in the qualification and the race are only drivers who are in 104% of their fastes class lap, taken ~23h before the race (right after FP2). This means 104% counted from the fastest PRO- and AM-time. If a driver is above 104% he still got time until drivers briefing. Times will be checked before the Qualifying with this Tool:

Live-Tracker (click me!)

The Qualification will start at 19:40 / 7:40 PM (CET / CEST) – a no show will result in a disqualification for the qualifying and the driver needs to start from the pits.
The Qualification will be 15 Minutes long, unless it will be claimed before the race otherwise. The endurance races (Nürburgring & Le Mans) will have a 1h qualifying starting at 13:45 / 2:00 PM (CET / CEST).
Both classes will be on track at the same time, during your in & outlap be aware of the other drivers on a hotlap.

If a driver feels like the Tracker is not working properly, he has the possibility to mention it. In this case the Race Control will check if there is a problem. If the suspicion is confirmed the driver is allowed to race.

The maximum times will be announced here: Qualification times (click me!)



Article 2.8 – Warm up

The warmup is a 5-Minute break between qualification and race (toilet break / eating / drinking).
Endurance races will have a 15 minutes Warm-up break.



Article 2.9 – Starting procedure

The Race weekend consists out of 2 Races. A 40min Race and a 20Min Race with a reversed grid(40:20R)
At 20:00 / 08:00 PM (CET / CEST) the first race will be started and will last around 40min.
The endurance race will start at 15:00 / 3:00 PM (CET / CEST).

The start will happen behind the SC. After the start lights go out the actual formation lap starts. Please let the car infront of you start before you start to move and leave some place between each other, to reduce accidents while warming up tires / brakes.
The SC will drive in a moderate speed (around 120 km/h) the gap to the car behind should not be more then 5-6 car lengths.
Overtaking is not permitted. If a car spins off (own mistake), it is allowed to get back on track an back into its original position – the driver has to make sure getting back to grid position is not endangering other drivers.

In Sector 3 the grid gets ready for the start. The drivers go into two rows and follow the SC. The drivers stay on the site they were standing in the starting grid, left stays left - right stays right. While being in two rows the drivers go side by side. The drivers are allowed to offset to the left or to the right for better overtaking, they just need to stay behind the 2 row infront of them. The SC will go into the pits at the end of the lap. When it turns into the pits, it will write "Green Flag!" within the next seconds. At the second, it appears, the race is started. Everyone is allowed to overtake and accelerate from this moment.
